# spirit-of-tkinter
Build an application with Tkinter step by step.

## How to use this repo

This repo progressively builds a desktop GUI using the Tkinter package. The steps are stored as dangling branches -- think of them as tags, for they progress in a linear fashion (but branches are much easier to revise).

Have or install Python 3.x/Tcl 8.5+ on your machine, then
``$ git checkout 00``
to begin. ``$ git branch`` will show a full list of the steps. (Ignore the master branch.)

At each new checkout start at look.txt, which directs you to the significant changes explained in comments embedded in the code files.

Also, it wouldn't hurt to have some Rush playing as you go through the steps.

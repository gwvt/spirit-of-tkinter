# How to use this repo

This repo walks through the steps of creating an application with Tkinter. The steps are stored as dangling branches -- think of them as tags, for they progress in a linear fashion (but branches are much easier to revise...).

Have or install Python 3.x/Tcl 9.5+ on your machine, then
``$ git checkout 00``
to begin. ``$ git branch`` will show a full list of the steps.

At each step start at look.txt, which directs you to the significant changes explained in comments embedded in the code.

Also, it wouldn't hurt to have some Rush playing as you peruse the code...
